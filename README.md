    cd server
    npm run dev
    ```

2. Start the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm start
    ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.


## Integration and Data Sharing
After testing requests in Postman, follow these steps to send data to MongoDB Compass:

1. Open MongoDB Compass and ensure the MongoDB server is active.
2. Create a new database in MongoDB Compass.
3. For Postman requests, ensure the data is accurate and conforms to the MongoDB format.
4. Use the "Save Response" feature in Postman to save the request response.
5. In MongoDB Compass, select the appropriate database and document to store the data.
6. Click "Refresh" and upload the data from the Postman response to MongoDB Compass.

This process ensures that the data sent from Postman is accurately stored and managed in your MongoDB database.
